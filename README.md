### `Skate Notes App`

Link to live app: https://skate-notes.vercel.app/

### `Purpose`

The `purpose` of this app is to help `skateboarders` take notes on how they do tricks.

The `notes page` has a `skateboard` and two `shoes`. The shoes are adjustable for each new note/trick so that you can remember how you position your feet. There is also a slot for `notes` where you can take notes on `tips` and `tricks` that helped you learn it.


The `login page` or `sign up page` can be used to login or create an account and be able to start saving notes.
